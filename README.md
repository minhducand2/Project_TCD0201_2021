"# Project_TCD0201_2021" 

This is my company's project, and I'm a major part of it. Also, the issues related to the API or something else are not mine, especially the API it is the company's and the servers belong to the company. Besides, this is a .Net core commercial sales website and its full name is "Commercial sales website .Net core" because the customer chose this name. Not only that, this project is completely owned by me and the client specified it. Moreover, this website links and shares to Facebook, Instagram, etc. Another surprise, pay for the product is PayPal and which will have 2 languages: English and Vietnamese. 

The project will design according to the Microservice model, Language for Front End will combine Angular 11 Framework, Language for Back End (Restful API) will use .NET Core, Database will use SQL server, All projects will be stored on the platform. Cloud computing platform with docker.
